#FuzzyQuantile

High performance quantile estimation(e.g. 90th, 95th, 99th) of streaming data, with user defined reasonable error (e.g 0.1%). 

This is an implementation of the algorithm presented in [Cormode, Korn, Muthukrishnan, and Srivastava. "Effective Computation of Biased Quantiles over Data Streams"](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~muthu/bquant.pdf) in ICDE 2005.
